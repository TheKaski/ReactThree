# Simple car game
This is a simple hobby project for developping a 3D physics based driving game with node.js and react.

## Physics:
Physics have been made using the CANNON.js library

## 3D graphics:
Graphics have been made using the library Three.js and the custom models were developped using blender.

## Gameplay:
The game is a simple timeAttack racer where the user drives the cute robot around a simple 3D track and tries to beat his/her best time continuously. The game allows drifting arround the slippery track and extra features might be added as development progresses.

## Launching the application:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
