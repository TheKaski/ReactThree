# Time attack racing game for delivery robot
This is a simple yet fun project implemented using Node.js together with React, CANNON.js and Three.js. The game is a simple time attack racing game where the player is trying to beat their own record lap time around a slippery track.

## Physics:
Physics have been made using the CANNON.js library using simple Plane, Box and Cylinder shapes together with a RaycastVehicle class.

## 3D graphics:
Graphics have been implemented using the Three.js library and the custom models were developped using Blender software.

## Gameplay:
The game is a simple timeAttack racer where the user drives the cute robot around a simple 3D track and tries to beat his/her best time continuously. The game allows drifting arround the slippery track and extra features might be added as development progresses.

## Launching the application:

### `npm start`
